MCI (My Chiplet Interface) is a fictive interface composed of two repair chain. Each of them is a bus of 16 bit in both direction (receive and transmit).
There is also power and ground connections on the interface but no clock or sideband. 

There is three versions of MCI.
The first version contains only two spares, one per repair chain. 
The repair strategy is the shift by one. 

The second version has the repair chains interleaved. It was done in order to reduce the number of unrepairable short. It also support the shift by one

The third version, also has the repair chains interleaved but it has two spares per repair chain and thus, support a shift left or shift right strategy.
