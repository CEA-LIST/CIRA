HYDRA (HYbrid bonDing Repair Architecture) is another fictive interface. 
The repair strategy is at bundle scale. Please refer to the section Usage\Example\Bundle Repair Mechanism in the README.md for more detail. 

This interface has two versions. 

The first one, called 16-1, is composed of 16-connections bundles. 
The second one, called 4-1, is composed of 4-connections bundles.

2RB is for 2 Repair Bundle, it means there is 2 Repair Bundle per 6 bundles. 
Hence one third of the connections are used for repair. 

3RB means that 1 half of the connections are used for repair.
